"complete" exercises
======================

This directory contains a directory for each of exercises 0-2, with completed
code. They are mainly to serve as a reference to the presenter, but can also be
used by participants if they get stuck or are unable to complete the exercise in
the time allotted.

If any of the exercises does not contain a vendor directory, or it is empty,
grab [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), and, from the directory, run:

```sh
php /path/to/composer.phar install
```
